identidy it fh codebase has all the below and optimized to the system workflow below 📥 1. Excel Upload (Admin)
Admin uploads an Excel file via web interface.

System reads the file using a library like PhpSpreadsheet.

Case-insensitive header matching ensures flexibility:

UHID, PatientName(Pname) ,ReffNo, Amount are detected regardless of case.

Extra columns are ignored.

🔄 2. Processing Each Row
For each row in the Excel:

Step 1: Sanitize and validate:

Ensure UHID, ReffNo, and Amount are present and valid.

Skip rows with missing/invalid values.

Step 2: Match UHID:

If UHID exists, continue.

If UHID doesn't exist, create patient record:

Name = PName

UHID = temp password

Step 3: Check transaction:

If ReffNo already exists → skip (no duplicate processing).

If ReffNo is new:

Points = Amount / X (X = 100 by default, configurable).

Round to 2 decimal places.

Add points to existing balance.

Update transaction log with:

ReffNo, Amount, UHID, Points awarded, Date, etc.

🧮 3. Tier Calculation
After updating total points:

< 500 → Bronze

501–999 → Silver

≥ 1000 → Gold

Store tier separately or recalculate dynamically.

🧾 4. Database Structure (Recommended Tables)
patients
id	uhid	name	password	tier	total_points	created_at

transactions
| id | uhid | reff_no | amount | points_awarded | date_uploaded | uploaded_by |

rewards
| id | name | description | points_required | tier_required | created_by | active |

redemptions
| id | patient_id | reward_id | redeemed_at | points_used | admin_id |

admins
| id | name | email | password | role |

config
| key | value |
(e.g. points_per_amount → 100)

🧑‍💻 PATIENT LOGIN
Login with: name + UHID (used as password).

Later: allow user to set/change password after first login.

Secure with password hashing (e.g., password_hash()).

👁️‍🗨️ PATIENT DASHBOARD
Show:

✅ Current points

✅ Tier (Bronze/Silver/Gold)

✅ Transactions (reffno, amount, date, points earned)

✅ Rewards available (filtered by tier and points)

✅ Redemption history

🛠️ ADMIN DASHBOARD
Upload Excel

Manage:

Patients

Rewards (add/edit/delete)

Redemptions

Transactions log

Configure:

Points-per-amount ratio

Tier thresholds

Export logs (CSV)

✅ BEST PRACTICES
⛓️ Transaction Deduplication
Enforce unique ReffNo at DB level using unique index.

Log skipped transactions for admin review.

🔐 Security
Sanitize all Excel inputs.

Use CSRF protection on form uploads.

Hash UHID or generated password using password_hash().

Use prepared statements or ORM to avoid SQL injection.

📁 File Handling
Validate file extension: .xls, .xlsx

Limit upload size (e.g., max 2MB)

Delete file after processing or store with logs.

🔄 Point/Tier Recalculation
Keep total points stored for speed.

Optionally allow "recalculate" feature in admin panel to re-tally all points and reset tier if bugs occur.

🔚 Redemption Flow
Patient clicks Redeem button.

Backend:

Checks if they meet points and tier criteria.

Deducts reward.points_required from patient.

Adds row in redemptions table.

Disallow redeeming if insufficient points.

✅ CONFIGURABLE ITEMS
Store in a config table or admin settings:

Points per amount ratio

Tier thresholds

Allowed file formats/sizes

Default password policy
